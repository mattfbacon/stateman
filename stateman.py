The purpose of StateMan is to manage state with explicit bindings for changes. In other similar state frameworks, the dependencies are automatically
detected. The goal of StateMan is to avoid unexpected updates based on dependency detection that thinks too highly of itself. StateMan requires the
user to provide the dependencies explicitly, so every update is expected.

StateMan does not track or detect external changes to properties. If you want a change that is not tracked to cause an update, it is most likely due to
the following situation:

You are externally changing properties of an object that was passed by reference to StateMan. Consider acting on the object within the StateMan instance.
Note that calling methods on the object will not cause an update even if you are acting on StateMan's reference. You may need to rethink your situation,
as generally an object with methods should not be part of the state.

However, for a simple way to manually cause an update, see ``_handle_change``. This is by no means discouraged and may well be necessary in a complex
situation, since StateMan is quite simple with respect to how it decides when to update.

Vocabulary:
- to Track: to store a value and possibly fulfill actions when the value is changed.
- to Depend on: to require an update when the dependency is updated.
- Property: a key and value that are tracked by StateMan.
- Static Property: a property that will only change if the user changes it.
- Dynamic Property: a property that is defined in terms of other properties. Dependencies are specified so StateMan knows when the property would update.
- Binding: a directive to StateMan to call the provided handler when the property it is bound to changes, whether as a result of being changed explicitly,\
or as a dynamic property being updated due to one of its dependencies updating. Similar to a "watcher" in other state management frameworks.
- Model: in the Model–View–Controller pattern, the model is "the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface." (from Wikipedia)

At the moment there is no way to "delete" a property, binding, or dependency, simply because the need has not come up for me and so it's not worth it to
needlessly expand the code. However, I may decide to implement it later, or if you submit a PR implementing it I will most likely merge it.'''

		'''Create a new StateMan instance.\n
		Arguments: `props` (dict) | Keyword Arguments: `literal` (bool, default False), `refs` (dict, default {})

		Static and dynamic properties can be defined in the `props` dictionary.
		The keys of the dictionary can be any type that can be used as a dictionary key, not just strings.
		For static properties, simply provide the value.
		For dynamic properties, for the value provide a tuple (or list) of the format `(getter, dependencies, setter?, cache?)`.
		`getter` is a function that takes the StateMan instance as its single argument.
		`dependencies` is a tuple (or list) of the properties (static or dynamic) that should, upon change, cause this property to be updated.
		`setter` is an optional function that takes the StateMan instance and the provided value as arguments. If a setter is not included then the property will
		not have a setter and will raise a `TypeError` upon attempts to set it.
		`cache` is an optional boolean for whether the property should be cached.
		For more detail about these options see the docstring for ``track_dynamic``.

		`literal` forces all entries in the dictionary to be treated as static properties, even if they look like a dynamic property.

		`refs` is included specifically for when certain objects need to be accessed by the handlers, like a window object for a GUI app.
		These could theoretically be stored in static properties, but for large objects that don't need to be tracked, moving them to `refs` may lead to
		slight performance improvements in some circumstances. However, the main reason you would do this is to prevent it from being bound, which would
		impact the performance.'''

		The handler takes two arguments: the model, which is just the StateMan instance, and the name of the property that changed. While for bindings to a single

		Arguments: `prop` (the name of the property), `getter` (a function taking the model and returning the property's value), `dependencies` (a tuple or list of
		the properties that this property "depends" on (i.e., which properties cause this property to update when they're updated) | Keyword Arguments: `cache`
		(whether the value for this property should be cached)

		Dynamic properties are arguably the most important StateMan feature. You may know them as "getters" or "computed properties" from other state management
		frameworks. However, as with everything else, dynamic properties in StateMan are explicit with respect to their dependencies. You provide them as you would
		with a binding, and StateMan will mark the property as updated (calling the bindings and updating any of its dependencies) when any of the properties in
		the list are updated.

		If you would like to provide a setter, specify it in the `setter` argument. The function takes the model and the provided value as arguments, and need not
		return anything. Since a dynamic property cannot be set directly, the purpose of a dynamic property's setter is to change the values of other static prop-
		erties or otherwise modify the state.

		In some cases, for example if the value of a dynamic property depends on external variables but you don't want to or can't include those variable in the
		state, you may not want the value of the dynamic property to be cached. In this case provide `False` to the keyword argument `cache`. By default dynamic
		properties are cached.'''
